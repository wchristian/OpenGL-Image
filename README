This module provides methods to load/modify/save images for use
with OpenGL textures, FBOs and VBOs.

It requires the OpenGL module - version 0.55_03 or newer.

It also requires at least one supported OpenGL::Image imaging engine.
At this time, the following  drivers are supported:

* Targa - Pure Perl - uncompressed RGBA files (comes with OpenGL::Image).
* ImageMagick - v6.3.5 or newer is recommended for the best performance.

You can find the latest releases and information for installing/using
